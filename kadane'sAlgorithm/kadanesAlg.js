// Kadane’s algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum subarray sum within a one-dimensional array. It efficiently computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for solving related problems.

// Kadane's Algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It is efficient, with a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛), where n is the number of elements in the array.
